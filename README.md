# Chicago_socioeconomic_data_analysis_SQL_Python
About Project:
In this project, I worked on a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal to analyse the socioeconomic factors in play among the population at Chicago.
ABOUT: 
Imagine, you have been hired by a non-profit organization that strives to improve educational outcomes for children and youth in the City of Chicago. Your job is to analyze the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district. You will identify causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health, environment ratings of schools. That was what I achieved in this project.

Requirements:Jupyter Notebook, SQLite, python, database.
